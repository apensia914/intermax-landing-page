                <strong>CEO Message</strong>
                I have long contemplated how to contribute to the lives of the people in the world and the ways to discover their potential and dreams. My conclusion to these questions all came down to the personality of the person – someone modest, who is always willing to learn and proactive in communicating with his colleagues, partners, and customers. Not only will the people with these traits succeed in life but I strongly believe that they will also contribute to the society and the country. In 1995, Intermax was established by such people. Now in 2015, 20 years later, we have flourished and enjoyed our success in the industry thanks to the help of our partners and cooperative firms. INTERMAX will extend the service and products range to include many more that will add value and contribute to the culture in addition to the apparel and textile products that we currently provide. To do so, we will prepare all our products through strict processes to provide the most value to our consumers, as an effort to take responsibility as a long-lasting company to the society. We promise to provide not only a mutually beneficial partnership but as well as exceptional value and experiences to our partners. Thank you for the interest and care that we have received.
